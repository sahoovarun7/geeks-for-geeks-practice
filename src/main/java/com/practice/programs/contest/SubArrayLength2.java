/**
 * Given an array A[ ] of N elements.
 * In one operation, you can select any subarray of length 2 and multiply all elements of that subarray by -1. You can do any number of operations (possibly zero).
 * Your task is to maximize the sum of all elements of all subarrays of A[ ].
 *
 *
 *
 * Input:
 * N = 3
 * A[] = {-1, -2, -3}
 * Output: 14
 * Explanation:
 * We can do 1 operation on subarray from
 * index = 2 to index = 3. After performing
 * the operation, modified array A[] =
 * {-1, 2, 3}. All subarrays  of the  modified
 * array A[] are [-1], [2], [3], [-1, 2], [2, 3]
 * and [-1, 2, 3]. Thus total sum of all
 * subarrays is 14. This is the maximum sum
 * which we can get by performing the
 * operations.
