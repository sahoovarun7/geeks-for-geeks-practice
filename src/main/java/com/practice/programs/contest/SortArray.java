/**
 *
 * Given an integer D and an array A[ ] of N integers.
 * At each operation you can select the elements which
 * are at index i and (i + D)%N and you can swap the
 * both elements. The task is to check if it
 * is possible to sort the array by performing the above operation zero or more times.
 *
 * Note: 0 based indexing is used.
 *
 *
 *
 * Input:
 * N = 4, D = 2
 * A[] = {3, 2, 1, 5}
 * Output:
 * Yes
 * Explanation:
 * We can sort the array in one operation.
 * 1st operation: swap(A[i], A[(i+D)%N])
 * where i = 0.
